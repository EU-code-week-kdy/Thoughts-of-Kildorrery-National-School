		<h1>What is EU Code Week?</h1>
		<h3>EU Code Week is a grass-roots movement that celebrates creativity, problem solving and collaboration through programming and other tech activities. The idea is to make programming more visible, to show young, adults and elderly how you bring ideas to life with code, to demystify these skills and bring motivated people together to learn</h3>
		

		
		<h1>What has kildorrery NS done for EU code week?</h1>

		<h3>Our aim was to get each student of Kildorrery National School to write a line of code which would be the content of this website called "Thoughts of Kildorrery National School" The framework of the website was prepared and each student  learned about the HTML and CSS of the segment they coded. Their segment displayed their "Name", "Age" and a sentence or thought of their choice in a bubble. You can see the <b>AWESOME</b> result on this website</h3>
	
	<p>Hosted by kildorrery N.S. Organised by Kildorrery N.S student Dillon Lynch of Coderdojo Mallow. Coded by all kildorrery N.S students</p>
